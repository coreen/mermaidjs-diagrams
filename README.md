# MermaidJS Diagrams

[MermaidJS](https://mermaidjs.github.io/#/) is a sweet editor for creating diagrams from text for displaying high-level understanding without spending too much time into creating boxes and arrows. This is a repo for keeping track of implemented diagrams using the [live editor](https://mermaidjs.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/#) so they can be recreated as necessary.

### Types

#### Sequence Diagrams

The most common use case I have for using this editor is the sequence diagram. Think of this as drawing lines for each peer associated with a certain transaction and the arrows between each line for send/receive messages. The code for this is fairly straightforward and you can dig more into features by looking [here](https://mermaidjs.github.io/#/examples?id=basic-sequence-diagram).

#### Graphs

If you want to show a graph-style diagram with groupings, use the flowchart type of diagraming style. More can be read on that [here](https://mermaidjs.github.io/#/flowchart).
